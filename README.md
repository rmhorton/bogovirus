# bogovirus
A toy disease progression model with confounding by severity.


This is a simple simulation of outcomes from a viral infection, designed to produce data from which we can learn causal models where we know what the correct answer should be, or use those models to create analytical simulations.

These are the online versions of the notebooks:

- [Bogovirus primary simulation](https://rmhorton.github.io/bogovirus/Bogovirus_simulation_notebook.html)
- [Bogovirus BN analytical simulation](https://rmhorton.github.io/bogovirus/Bogovirus_simsim_notebook.html)

This repository was originally hosted under the [Virtual Generalist]((https://rmhorton.github.io/virtual-generalist) repo, but we split it out to make it easier to find and manage.
